# Demonstration: Deploy Azure Kubernetes Cluster Mission Enclave using Azure DevOps Services and Terraform

<div class="title">Using Azure DevOps Services for an enclave deployment using the NoOps Accelerator for a Azure Kubernetes Service private cluster and mission landing zone.
</div>

### Setup & Prerequisite Software

1. You must have installed the latest [Git client](https://git-scm.com) for working with source control

1. You must have the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for authoring bicep files

1. Installed the [bicep extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#vs-code-and-bicep-extension) in Visual Studio Code

1. You must have installed either the the latest version of **AZ CLI**, see [How to install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), or **Azure PowerShell**, see [Install the Azure Az PowerShell module](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps?view=azps-9.0.1) for deploying bicep files

    **PowerShell Quick Installation for Azure CLI**
    ``` PowerShell
    $ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows -OutFile .\AzureCLI.msi; Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList '/I AzureCLI.msi /quiet'; rm .\AzureCLI.msi
    ```

    **PowerShell Quick Installation for Azure PowerShell**
    ``` PowerShell
    Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
    ```

1. You must have installed the latest version of [Azure Terraform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#azure-powershell)

1. Either clone, fork, or download the [NoOps Accelerator](https://github.com/Azure/NoOpsAccelerator) to your local system.  This demonstration uses **c:\anoa** as the root directory containing the downloaded, cloned, or forked project from GitHub

### Before we Begin

You will be making modifications to several .json files for the deployment which require knowing several sensitive pieces of information.  You will also create a group in Azure Active Directory, and you will need that group's object id.  Finally, you will be creating an application registration in Azure Active Directory and will need the client id and secret.

You can record those values here or, preferred, using your terminal save the values as variables.  Additionally, you can record and save these values in Azure Key Vault if using the Azure NoOps Accelerator on a pipeline or through a automation platform.

Saving data as variables for use while executing this demonstration or lab will help.  This code below will make executing the commands through PowerShell simpler and recalling these values.

``` PowerShell
az cloudset --name [AzureCloud | AzureGovernment]
az login
$context = Get-AzContext
$location = [your region]
```

### Part 1: Setup Azure DevOps Services

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: If you are on an Azure government cloud, Azure DevOps Services is not available.  You can access the service, but you will not be able to choose an Azure government region to host your Azure DevOps Services.  In this situation, either deploy Azure DevOps Server as a VM or a physical server in your environment.

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: If you are using a VM or on-premise Azure DevOps Server, replace **dev.azure.com** with your deployment URL for this demonstration.

---

#### Create an Account or Sign-In to Azure DevOps Services

1. Navigate to [https://dev.azure.com](https://dev.azure.com) and create an account or log in

#### Create a new Project

1. Create a new project with the following settings:

    - Name: **anoa**

    - Description: **Azure NoOps Accelerator**

    - Visibility: **Enterprise** *or* **Private**

    - Advanced:

        - Version Control: **Git**

        - Work item process: **Agile**

#### Download the Azure NoOps Accelerator and Create a Repository

1. Download the latest Azure NoOps Acelerator version from [https://github.com/Azure/NoOpsAccelerator/releases](https://github.com/Azure/NoOpsAccelerator/releases) and unzip to a directory on your computer.  This demonstration uses **c:\anoa** as the root directory.

1. Open PowerShell or your terminal of choice and change to the directory where you unzipped the Azure NoOps Accelerator

    ``` PowerShell
    Set-Location -Path 'c:\anoa'
    ```

1. Issue Git commands to create a repository

    ``` PowerShell
    git init .
    git add *
    git commit -m "Initialized ANOA"
    ```

1. Connect your local repository to Azure DevOps Services and push your changes

    ``` PowerShell
    git remote add origin https://<your login name>@dev.azure.com/<your organization name>/<your project name>/_git/anoa
    git push -u origin --all
    ```

#### OPTIONAL: Setup Areas and Iterations for Incremental Development

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: This step demonstrates setting up a hierarical backlog using a three week sprint for controlling and releasing changes on a predictable schedule.

1. In Azure DevOps Services, click on **Project Settings** found at the bottom left of the page

1. In the **Boards** section, click on **Project Configuration**

##### OPTIONAL: Setup Areas

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: Areas are used here to create a hierarchy to show progress and effort roll-up for enterprise reporting.  This is just an example below.  You could also use your archetypes or management groups in Azure as a basis for establishing this structure.

1. Create a new child under **anoa** named **Modern Portfolio**

1. Create a new child under **Modern Portfolio** named **Mission Owner Alpha**

1. Create a new child under **Mission Owner Alpha** named **NoOps Team**

1. Create a new child under **Mission Owner Alpha** named **Application Development Team**

1. Create a new child under **Modern Portfolio** named **Mission Owner Bravo**

##### OPTIONAL: Setup Iterations

1. Click on Iterations found at the top breadcrumb navigation element

1. Delete the pre-configured **Iteration 1**, **Iteration 2**, and **Iteration 3** elements

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: Adjust the years/dates to represent your current dates

1. Create a new child under **anoa** named **Fiscal Year 2023**

   - Start Date: 7/1/2022

   - End Date: 6/30/2023

1. Create a new child under **Fiscal Year 2022** named **Program Increment 1**

   - Start Date: 7/1/2022

   - End Date:  9/23/2022

        Use this PowerShell snippet to calculate the Program Increment period:
   
         $d = ([DateTime]'7/1/2022').AddDays(84); while ($d.DayOfWeek -eq "Saturday" -or $d.DayOfWeek -eq "Sunday") { $d = $d.AddDays(1) }; $d

        The $d = ([DateTime]'7/1/2022') part of the PowerShell is the start of the Program Increment.  If you need to make a second Program Increment change the $d = ([DateTime]'7/1/2022') statement to the start of the second Program Increment, for example: $d = ([DateTime]'9/23/2022')

1. Create a new child under **Program Increment 1** named **Sprint 1**

    - Start Date: 7/1/2022

    - End Date: 7/21/2022  **Note:** This is a three week sprint

1. Create the remaning two sprints in **Program Increment 1**:

    - Name: **Sprint 2**

    - Start Date: 7/22/2022
    
    - End Date: 8/11/2022

    - Name: **Sprint 3**

    - Start Date: 8/12/2022

    - End Date: 9/1/2022

1. Create the **Innovation & Planning Sprint**:

    - Name: IP Sprint

    - Start Date: 9/2/2022

    - End Date: 9/23/2022

##### OPTIONAL: Configure the 'anoa Team' for Iterations and Areas

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: You would use this process for any other teams created in this project to establish enterprise alingment and autonomy.

1. Click on **Team Configuration** found under the **Boards** heading while in the **Project Configuration**

1. Verify that you have **anoa Team** chosen with the Team Selector on the top-most breadcrump navigation element.

1. Uncheck the box for **Features**

> <span class="note">NOTE</span>: Typically, when establishing enterprise autonomy and alignment, you will not have an Azure Board expose more than one type of backlog item.  A different team would be responsible for creating Features.  Creating Features would happen on the Program Increment Planning sessions.

1. Choose **Bugs are managed with requirements** in the **Working with bugs** section.  This will allow bugs to visually appear on your Azure Board.

1. Click on **Iterations**, then click on **+ Select Iteration(s)** and assign the **anoa Team** only the sprints including the IP sprint

1. Click on **Areas** in the breadcrumb navigation element

1. Click on **change** and navigate the hierarchy and choose **anoa Team**

1. In the area listed below, hover over the area, click the ellipses, then choose **include sub-areas**

1.  You have completed configuration a Team for use with a hierarchy of time and areas.

### OPTIONAL: Part 2: Using Kanban for Change Visibility

This is the entry point for Developers, Cyber, and Operations to shift-left and work together for changes.  A new team will be created called **anoa Team**.  This is an Azure AD backed team.  Add the Developers, Cyber, and Operations persons to this team which will grant access to the repository for changes.
